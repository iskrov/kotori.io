  "faq": {
    "headline": "Frequently asked questions",
    "items": [
      { "q": "Is Kotori helpful for ADHD and autism journaling?", "a": "Yes! Many parents and individuals with ADHD, autism, and other neurodivergent conditions find Kotori's voice-first approach ideal. The hands-free capture eliminates the friction of traditional journaling, while our gentle prompts help maintain consistency without overwhelming executive function." },
      { "q": "How can I share notes with my child's therapist or doctor?", "a": "You can generate secure, read-only summaries for therapists, doctors, or specialists in any language they prefer. These summaries include only what you choose to share, and access can be revoked anytime. Perfect for IEP meetings, therapy sessions, or medical appointments." },
      { "q": "Which languages are supported for special needs documentation?", "a": "Kotori supports 100+ languages! Document in your native language and share summaries in English (or any other language) with teachers, therapists, or healthcare providers. This is especially helpful for multilingual families navigating special education or therapy services." },
      { "q": "Can multiple caregivers track the same child?", "a": "While each caregiver maintains their own private journal, you can easily share observations with co-parents, teachers, or care teams. This helps everyone stay aligned on behavioral patterns, medication effects, sleep changes, or developmental milestones." },
      { "q": "Is this suitable for tracking behavioral patterns and triggers?", "a": "Absolutely. Parents often use Kotori to track meltdowns, sensory triggers, medication responses, sleep patterns, and developmental progress. The voice capture makes it easy to record in-the-moment observations that might otherwise be forgotten." },
      { "q": "How secure is my family's sensitive health information?", "a": "Your data is encrypted and private by default. We cannot access your entries. This is crucial when documenting sensitive information about developmental delays, behavioral challenges, or medical conditions. You control all sharing." },
      { "q": "Does Kotori provide medical or therapeutic advice?", "a": "No. Kotori is a journaling tool that helps you organize observations for your own reference or to share with professionals. We don't diagnose conditions or recommend treatments‚Äîwe simply help you capture and organize important moments." }
